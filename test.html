    <h1>London</h1>
    <p> Sooo, like, London, right? It's, uh, this super big city and, um,
         totally the capital of England and the UK, with, like,
          nearly 9 million people wandering around in 2023?
           Uh, its whole area is, like, the biggest in Western Europe,
            with, like, 15.1 million?! London kinda sits awkwardly
             on the River Thames, with this, like, gross 50-mile stretch 
             all the way to the North Sea, and, yeah, it's been a place
              where people hung out for, like, 2,000 years or something.
               Wow. The City of London’s this ancient bit the Romans
                called Londinium, and it’s like, still kinda medieval,
                 if you squint at it? So, uh, to the west is Westminster,
                  which has been dealing with government stuff for ages,
                   like, since forever. London had this super growth spurt
                    in the 19th century, becoming, like, the biggest city
                     in the world back then, which is, um, kinda cool,
                      I guess? After that, 'London' became this weird term
                       for the whole area and, like, now it's Greater London
                        with all these local authorities—33, I think?
                         Ugh, who even counts that? Anyway, London’s,
                          like, a big deal globally, influencing stuff 
                          like art and finance and all that jazz.
                           It’s, um, also the most economically powerful city
                            in Europe, so there's that. 
                            Plus, it’s got, like, more universities than
                             you can shake a stick at—over 50—and about half 
                             a million students? Crazy, right? It’s home to,
                              you know, some 'leading' academic institutions 
                              like Imperial College and UCL, but like,
                               who’s counting rankings? Just kinda awkwardly impressive, I guess?   </p>
